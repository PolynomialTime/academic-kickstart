I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science, [The University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/). My supervisor is Dr. [Jiamou Liu](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jliu036/). 

I received my First Class Honours degree in computer science from The University of Auckland in 2018. 
I received my B.S. in computer science from [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn/index.htm) in 2017.

My research interests include social networks analysis, multi-agent systems, and deep reinforcement learning. Lately my research focus is on applying deep reinforcement learning and graph neural networks to graph-structured data.
